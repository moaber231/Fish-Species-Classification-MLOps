# In-Depth Change Analysis

This revision covers the files edited and created in the.

## Runtime and Core Logic

- [src/group_56/api.py](src/group_56/api.py): Major API uplift (M22, M23, M27, M28). Adds Prometheus metrics
  (request counts, errors, latency, model load), mounts `/metrics`, and introduces `/monitoring` that renders
  Evidently HTML from logged predictions. Prediction handler validates image types, extracts structured features,
  logs each prediction to a local prediction database (M27), and batches GCS uploads every 10 rows. Model loading
  pulls from GCS with gsutil fallback, selects CUDA/MPS/CPU automatically, records metadata in `MODEL_INFO`, and
  exposes `/model/info` and hardened `/health`. Error counters are labeled for observability (M28), and top-k
  responses are returned consistently.
- [src/group_56/data_drift.py](src/group_56/data_drift.py): New Evidently-driven drift module (M27) that loads recent
  predictions, builds reference/current splits, generates DataDrift/DataQuality/TargetDrift reports, saves
  `data_drift_report.html`, and runs test suites for pass/fail signaling. Includes CLI entry to run end-to-end from
  the terminal.
- [src/group_56/extract_features.py](src/group_56/extract_features.py): New image feature extractor (M27) computing
  brightness, contrast, Laplacian sharpness, per-channel mean/std, aspect ratio, and approximate size, enabling
  drift on tabular features derived from images.
- [src/group_56/train.py](src/group_56/train.py): Training pipeline updated for sweep compatibility (M14), improved
  logging, config handling, and artifact persistence to align with new Docker and workflow paths (M10, M21).
- [src/group_56/evaluate.py](src/group_56/evaluate.py): Evaluation path refreshed to consume new artifacts/configs;
  aligns with sweep outputs and logging conventions (M14, M16).
- [src/group_56/model.py](src/group_56/model.py): Model wrapper adjusted for new loading/saving conventions and
  metadata exposure; supports downstream API usage (M22, M23).
- [src/group_56/sweep_agent.py](src/group_56/sweep_agent.py): New sweep runner coordinating W&B sweeps for
  hyperparameter search (M14), bridging configs and train/eval routines.
- [src/group_56/data.py](src/group_56/data.py): Data utilities refined to support training/eval data flows consistent
  with new features; minor robustness tweaks (M6, M16).
- [src/group_56/convert_txt_to_csv.py](src/group_56/convert_txt_to_csv.py): Data prep helper tweaked to produce
  consistent CSV inputs for downstream pipelines (M6).

## Monitoring, Alerting, and Ops

- [scripts/setup_gcp_monitoring.sh](scripts/setup_gcp_monitoring.sh): Automates GCP Monitoring setup (M28). Creates an
  email channel and three alert policies (error rate, latency, unresponsive service) with validation commands and
  manual fallbacks.
- Prometheus and drift wiring: Metrics are exposed via `/metrics` for Cloud Run scraping; `/monitoring` reuses
  prediction logs to compute drift and serve interactive HTML.

## CI/CD and Build

- [.github/workflows/data-change.yaml](.github/workflows/data-change.yaml): New workflow triggered on data updates to
  retrain/evaluate and keep artifacts fresh (M19, M21).
- [.github/workflows/model-registry.yaml](.github/workflows/model-registry.yaml): New workflow for model promotion and
  registry interactions (M19).
- [.github/workflows/tests.yaml](.github/workflows/tests.yaml): Test workflow expanded to cover new dependencies and

  alignment with sweep/training entrypoints (M10, M21).
