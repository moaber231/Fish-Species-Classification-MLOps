Image feature extraction for data drift detection.

Since data drift detection tools like Evidently work on structured/tabular data,
we need to extract numerical features from images. This module extracts features
such as brightness, contrast, sharpness, and color statistics that can be used
to detect distribution shifts in image data over time.
