# Machine Learning Operation Project Description- Image Classification on fish species dataset.


## Project Goal

The overall goal of this project is to design, implement, and rigorously evaluate an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for image-based fish species classification. The task focuses on automatically identifying the species of a fish from an input image, a problem with practical relevance in marine biology, fisheries management, environmental monitoring, and automated underwater analysis systems.

Beyond achieving strong predictive performance, the project emphasizes reproducibility, structured experimentation, and scalability by following a principled MLOps-oriented workflow. This includes systematic data versioning, configuration-driven experimentation, model tracking, and deployment-ready practices, ensuring that results are reliable, transparent, and easily reproducible.

## Data

For this project, we used the Fish Species Classification dataset, which consists of approximately 4000 labeled RGB images distributed across ~450 different fish species. The dataset consists of 3 folder of images (cropped,raw,numbered), and one .txt file which gives us more details about the labels of the images. This project addresses a fine-grained image classification problem, where the goal is to differentiate between visually similar fish species. In such settings, high-quality, discriminative visual features are critical, and irrelevant background information can negatively affect model performance.

For this reason, we exclusively use the cropped images provided with the dataset. These images contain only the fish itself, with background regions removed through manual cropping. Since this is a classification task—not an object detection task—the presence of background pixels does not provide additional useful information and may instead introduce noise.

The images depict fish under diverse real-world conditions, including variations in:

- lighting
- orientation and pose
- scale

These factors introduce both intra-class variability and inter-class similarity, making the classification task non-trivial.

The data modality consists of static color images. All images will be resized to a fixed resolution suitable for convolutional neural networks (e.g., 224×224 RGB pixels). The dataset will be split into training, validation, and test sets, and these splits will be kept consistent across all experiments to ensure fair and reproducible comparisons.

## Models and Methodology

To benchmark performance on the fish species classification task, we evaluate convolutional neural networks based on transfer learning. Specifically, we train and assess pretrained ResNet architectures, including ResNet-18, ResNet-50 and/or ResNet-34. These models are widely used for image classification and are known to generalize well, particularly in settings where the available training data is limited.

All models are initialized with weights pretrained on ImageNet and fine-tuned on our dataset. To ensure compatibility with these pretrained weights, we apply the official torchvision preprocessing pipeline for ResNet models, which is aligned with ImageNet statistics. This preprocessing strategy is well suited for transfer learning and helps maintain consistency between the training data and the distribution on which the models were originally trained.

```
git clone 
```

Install requirements, preferably in seperate virtual environment:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to run

Running the training locally:

```
invoke train
```

Evaluate the model:

```
invoke evaluate
```
